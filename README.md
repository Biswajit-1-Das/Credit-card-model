# Credit-card-fraud-detection-model
This repository houses a machine learning model designed for credit card fraud detection, employing various classification algorithms. The project's core objective is to compare the efficacy of models such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, utilizing a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics. It addresses the critical issue of credit card fraud by developing a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions from historical data, focusing on the comparative analysis of different classification models. The project utilizes a publicly available, imbalanced credit card transaction dataset, containing features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables. Implemented models include Linear Regression, employed for classification through thresholding, and Logistic Regression, a standard binary classification algorithm. The implementation, using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, follows a workflow of data loading and preprocessing, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrices. The analysis culminates in a comparison of model effectiveness, visualized through plots and charts, and documented findings. To use the model, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the main script. Future improvements aim to incorporate advanced models, feature engineering, real-time detection, hyperparameter tuning, and refined imbalance handling. Contributions to the project are encouraged
